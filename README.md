# Snipcart Webhooks Handler - DEMO

This is a dummy demo about how to handle Snipcart webhooks via a simple NodeJS Express app.

Please note that not all the webhooks are handled. As of now only the Webhooks for taxes calculation are.

This is very WIP.

## Getting started

Start by cloning this repo. Then install dependencies via `npm`.

```
npm install
```

Then you can start the web server with `nodemon` if you are developing with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Or you can start the webserver directly with node using:

```
npm start
```

The web server will start on `http://localhost:8181`.
